I spoke to a BT (Probably lead BT based on the amount of information he seemed to have).  I explained the past communications I have had with Savanna.  He said they will probably not be interested in picking us up at the moment because they just brought on a different new edible (he said it was a brownie).  Said they had been trying to get them in the door for a while.  Sucks they brought on a different product before us, but it is reassuring that it seems like they do have a list of new vendors they are slowly going down.<br/><br/>

Went over price drop on ccs and sell through guarantee and product switch out for the future. She is interested in working with us again just bad timing it's slow and its a money issue. She said they had a customer come in today and ASK FOR BLISS which they don't carry but I emailed her on and she wants a sample next week for sure. This should be an easy order to take in February when they get their cash flow right and we can hopefully do a good size order for them on ccs or 5150 and on BLISS. <br/><br/>

Also that dropping the price would make it a competitive price for the gummy market. 
She also mentioned she would enjoy a vendor day, when your ready for me to do these I think zuni would be a great place to start. <br/><br/>
